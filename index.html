        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a front-end / full stack engineer with 13 years of&nbsp;professional experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main areas of expertise are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating large single page web applications for both mobile (hybrid) and&nbsp;desktop</li>
          <li>Making snappy and pixel perfect user interfaces with&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;detail</li>
          <li>Implementing complex UI components including transitions, animations, and&nbsp;gestures</li>
          <li>Creating REST API using OpenAPI and NodeJS</li>
          <li>Scripts, pipelines, playbooks, and tooling for&nbsp;CI/CD</li>
          <li>Unit and E2E tests</li>
          <li>Performance in Web</li>
          <li>Documentation</li>
          <li>UI/UX</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I mainly focus on front end, but&nbsp;also have some production experience and interest
          in&nbsp;server-side technologies including REST APIs, databases, monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about design of everything&thinsp;—&thinsp;not only UI,
          but&nbsp;also design of developer experience which includes things like
          API design, documentation, tooling, maintainability, processes, releases, deprecation,
          and breaking changes management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&nbsp;am equally comfortable with vanilla technologies and modern frameworks
          such as Angular or&nbsp;React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&nbsp;prefer to work in small multidisciplinary self-sufficient and independent teams
          that follow Agile methodology and are responsible for the full product development cycle
          from the ideas&nbsp;and business analysis to&nbsp;the&nbsp;release, documentation, maintenance, and&nbsp;support.
        </p>
        <p>
          I participate in hiring process.
          Often, I&nbsp;act as a mentor to&nbsp;my&nbsp;peers.
          I&nbsp;believe that pair programming is better than&nbsp;code&nbsp;reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a user and customer advocate.

                  I&nbsp;created and released Remote config web app that allows to&nbsp;toggle features in production mobile and
                  web apps remotely without redeploying them. The technology stack for this application is Angular 11,
                  TypeScript, RxJS, Material UI, Docker, Nginx.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Collaborated with our PO and designer to improve UI/UX of&nbsp;the web app. Added some micro-animations to
                  interactive elements. Improved loading experience by adding page skeletons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&nbsp;created and released an SDK that allows developers to&nbsp;toggle features in their Angular apps

                  A quote from my colleague:
                  <q>To be honest, this is one of the&nbsp;few amazing products i've ever interacted with</q>

                <p>
                  I&nbsp;created a setup for E2E test and helped QA with writing the specs. I came up and applied some best
                  practices for making E2E tests reliable and deterministic. As a result 100% of our tests are
                  deterministic, e.g. no flaky test cases. Also they are independent so any test can be run in
                  isolation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I wrote Bash scripts and created CI/CD Jenkins pipelines for&nbsp;Remote config web app and SDK.
                  I&nbsp;managed to keep the average build time on Jenkins within 3–4 minutes
                  which not&nbsp;only makes developer experience great but also allows making releases in a few minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I participated in hiring process by reviewing candidates' home assignments and doing technical
                  interviews.

                  I was the creator of Hybrid SDK (HSDK) — a&nbsp;component that enables customers to make native-like hybrid
                  applications without a hassle.
                  I&nbsp;initiated and pitched creation of this component, then designed,
                  implemented, documented, and released it.
                  After the release I gave several on-site and online trainings and
                  workshops to help the customers to adopt it.
                  HSDK implements standard native navigation patterns with
                  smooth 60 fps transitions and makes it possible to use web apps (such as Angular or React SPA) on mobile
                  as hybrid apps or PWA.
                  It's made in a highly customisable manner with&nbsp;a&nbsp;headless core and replaceable UI.
                  HSDK enables customers to use a&nbsp;single codebase for their apps on all platforms including the Web, iOS and
                  Android.
                  Follow&nbsp;the&nbsp;links in the About section to see the demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of HSDK project I implemented a set of UI components for mobile including a library for gesture
                  recognition; added some standards gestures such as pan and&nbsp;swipe.
                </p>

              <div class="column">
                <p>
                  I implemented a component called BBXHR to&nbsp;replace the native `XMLHttpRequest` and `window.fetch` with a
                  custom JavaScript implementation that preserves the standard API but uses a native plugin under-the-hood
                  for making network requests. This component allowed all the existing customers of the company to migrate
                  their hybrid apps from old deprecated UIWebView to WKWebView (which doesn’t allow cross-origin requests)
                  without making extra effort. The custom implementation is fully spec compliant including support for
                  multipart FormData, binary data, streaming, etc. Also it's fully covered with integration tests. When
                  working on this component I also contributed the native plugins codebase written in Java and Objective-C.

                For a Dutch startup (<a href="https://app.geton.report" target="_blank">https://app.geton.report</a>)
                I&nbsp;launched a&nbsp;distributed system for collecting data from multiple sources and
                generating reports based on it. I&nbsp;was responsible for implementing REST API, Web app, PDF generator,
                crawlers, and a&nbsp;custom task queue processor. The technology stack was NodeJS, Postgres and Nginx.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&nbsp;created a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that allows to use the&nbsp;API in a convenient and type safe manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote Ansible playbooks and Bash scripts for CI and deployment on Digital Ocean servers. I was also

                setup, best security practices, configuring firewalls, automated Let's Encrypt certificates

                  I designed and implemented an advanced task queue manager for collecting the data from various sources and

                  It&nbsp;has a smart order detection based on the declared dependencies between

                  Implemented a&nbsp;canvas based component that could render a&nbsp;large number of elements

                  I made the web app ready for Retina by replacing PNG images and sprites with SVG images.

                  Added feature toggling to the web app to rollout features gradually.

                  This made the product reliable for the users who had incorrect date handling in their OS and browsers
                  (~10% of our users) — think of outdated Windows XP/7 with disabled automatic updates. Also this enabled us
                  to support custom timezones, e.g. timezones different from the user’s system timezone.

                <p>
                  I increased code coverage from 0 to 40% for legacy code and&nbsp;to&nbsp;90% for new code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I migrated the large codebase to modules and implemented a&nbsp;custom build script for bundling based on the
                  dependency tree (Webpack wasn't a&nbsp;thing yet).
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&nbsp;initiated and implemented scripts for real user performance monitoring and identified the key metrics to&nbsp;monitor.
                  I&nbsp;decreased loading time by&nbsp;50% for 60th percentile and 80% for 90th percentile.
                  Improved runtime performance for&nbsp;“heavy” users by x10 which made the product usable
                  for the users who have lots of data.

                  In the first week after joining the company I&nbsp;created a proof-of-concept of the front end for&nbsp;a&nbsp;brand new
                  project hlx.com. The PoC was received so well that the customer decided to sign a contract for creating the front
                  end even though they initially planned to outsource only the back end and do the front end themselves.
